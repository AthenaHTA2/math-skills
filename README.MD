Follow below steps to test math-skills.go

Download the 'math-skills' executable from root/public and give executable permissions.
Open a terminal and run the executable. The executable will generate a data file (= data.txt), and print the correct program outputs in the console.

Next, in VSC terminal type: go run main.go data.txt
The program works correctly if outputs on the terminal are exactly the same as outputs in the console. 

Repeat the test three times.
